# ITech IT8512 Python Library

The [Itech IT8512](http://www.itech.sh/en/products.jsp?id=12&sortid=001008) is a programmable DC electronic load. 

It seems to be an exact copy of the [BK precision 8500](http://www.bkprecision.com/products/dc-electronic-loads/8500-300-w-programmable-dc-electronic-load.html)

It has a serial port for remote control and monitoring, and some windows software. 

Luckily the 8500 comes with a python library! The library is available with an MIT license from the link above.

This repo contains a slightly modified version of the client to work with linux systems. 

It also contains a script I wrote to do battery testing with CSV logging. The BK software package comes with a more in depth demonstration and a decent PDF.
